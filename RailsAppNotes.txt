Go to http://railswizard.org/ and copy command like rails new Store -m http://railswizard.org/cbb1bd4b6b18c38d52a9.rb -J -T and run it in the comsole (make sure you're in the right directory...rails will create the top-level directory named for the project).

cd into new directory.
check out Gemfile and make sure it has all needed gems (don't forget to add 'pry' at the top level).
run $ bundle install.
run any installers needed for gems to operate (rails g rspec:install).
create 3 new databases (project_dev, project_test, project_prod)  and add those names to config/database.yml.
setup config/application.rb to your liking.
In order to use capybara from within rspec add these 3 lines to spec_helper.rb [require 'capybara/rails', require 'capybara/rspec', include Capybara::DSL].
